variables: temperature; can be represented as a 5x5x3 array, with constant values for each day
dimensions: time, latitude, longitude; time indicates when the measurement happened; we can encode the dates as 2022-09-01, 2022-09-02, and 2022-09-03.
the pairs of latitude and longitude values indicate the positions of the weather stations
- latitude has values 30,40,50,60, and 70, measured in degrees North
- longitude has values 60,70,80,90, and 100, measured in degrees East

How will adding the average temp data change the dataset variables, attributes, and dimensions?
time dimension would change (shorten); variables: new variable added to temperature 
temperature data stasy the same; we can represent theh average temperature as a single 5x5 array with value 1 at each cell. 

dimensions
the complete dataset still has three dimensions: time, latitude, and longitude
temp variable uses all three dimensions, and the average temperature variable only uses two. it's ok if a variable does not incorporate all dimensions in the dataset. 

attributes: keep all previous attributes and add the attributes for our new average temp variable


what are coordinates?

variables: n-dimensional arrays of numbers; we measure temp
dimensions: describe the axes of the arrays ; with respect to what are we measuring the variable? constant/fixed/independent quantities at which we measure the variables

coordinates: each dimension has a set of coordinates; coordinates indicate the dimensions values; at which points in this dimension are we measuring the variable? we measure the temperature variable at 60,70,10, degrees along the longitude dimension
coordinates depend on dimensions; coordinates are coordinates of specific dimension

indexing in 2 dimensional numpy.arrays starts at the top-left corner of the array, and it is done by rows first and columns second.
- 1st dimension = time

- 2nd dimension = latitude

- 3rd dimenion = longitude

the coordinates (values of each dimension) are:
time coordinates
latitude coordinates
longitude coordinates
